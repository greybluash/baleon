As we enter the world of AI, let's go on a journey to see how far we can push ChatGPT in learning a skill that usually takes years to master!


# Can ChatGPT Teach Me to Make Gluten-Free Sourdough From Scratch?

They say making sourdough bread is a craft that takes years to perfect.  
They also say making *gluten-free* sourdough is even harder — more unpredictable, more delicate, and more mysterious.

So, naturally, I thought… what if I didn’t learn it from a baker at all?

What if I asked **ChatGPT** to teach me?

Welcome to my new kitchen experiment: a real-time, flour-covered journey to see if AI can guide me through something that has humbled even the most passionate home bakers — creating a gluten-free sourdough starter and baking a loaf from scratch.

## 🧪 Why Gluten-Free Sourdough?

I’m gluten-free by necessity, not trend, and I *miss* real bread. You know — crusty outside, tangy inside, good enough to eat plain with a slather of butter.

Gluten-free bread at the store? It often tastes like cardboard and costs more than a sandwich.

Sourdough has that *magic* — natural fermentation, wild yeast, and deep flavor. But gluten-free sourdough? That’s next-level. No gluten means no built-in structure, which makes it notoriously tricky to work with. You need science, timing, and patience.

Perfect time to bring in an AI sidekick, right?

## 🤖 The Rules of the Experiment

- I’ll follow **ChatGPT’s instructions**, step by step.
- I’ll document **everything** — the good, the bad, and the bubbly.
- No cheating with premade starters or store-bought mixes.
- If I fail, I fail. But if I succeed? I get warm, fresh bread and the bragging rights that a robot helped me make it.

Each day, I’ll update this post (or future entries) with what happened, photos, and what ChatGPT told me to do.

## 📅 The Plan (According to ChatGPT)

1. **Days 1–7**: Build a gluten-free sourdough starter from scratch using brown rice flour and filtered water. Feed it daily, watch it bubble, and try not to panic if it smells weird.
2. **Day 8**: Mix and ferment the dough using the now-active starter.
3. **Day 9**: Shape, proof, and bake.
4. **After**: Taste, analyze, and decide if the experiment was a delicious success or a floury flop.

## 📸 Documenting the Journey

I'll include daily photos, notes, smells (described, not shared — you're welcome), and results. If I tweak something, I’ll explain why.

You’ll get:
- Honest reactions (some may be unprintable)
- Unexpected insights
- Tips for anyone else trying this gluten-free baking thing with or without AI

## 🔥 Why This Matters (At Least to Me)

I’m doing this because I love learning through doing — and because I think AI has the power to become an amazing tool for teaching skills that usually take months or years to master. Not just coding or writing, but *craft*. Physical things. Delicious things.

If ChatGPT can help me bake a beautiful, edible, gluten-free sourdough loaf?  
That's not just bread. That’s potential.

Let’s see what happens.
