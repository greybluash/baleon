# The Most Cost-Effective Way to Heat Your Pool in San Jose, CA

If you're lucky enough to have a pool in sunny San Jose, California, you probably want to maximize your swim time without running up a massive utility bill. Heating your pool efficiently comes down to combining three things: smart scheduling, leveraging solar energy, and using your existing equipment wisely.

## The Strategy: Solar + Auto Cover + Targeted Gas Heating

Your pool holds 15,600 gallons and currently has a gas heater, an auto cover, and a variable speed Jandy pump. Your goal is to heat the pool from 67°F to a comfortable 82°F for weekend use, without spending a fortune.

Gas heat is fast but expensive. Solar heat is free but slow. The best approach? Use your gas heater to quickly "kickstart" the temperature, then let the sun and your cover maintain it.

## Heating Cost Breakdown

To raise the pool temperature 15°F using only your gas heater:

- Requires approx. 23.4 therms of natural gas
- At $2.88178 per therm, that's **$67.42**

Instead, we'll blend that cost across a few days for efficiency.

## 3-Day Solar-Only Heating Schedule

Even without using gas, you can make significant temperature gains with solar heat and an auto cover. Here’s a revised plan:

| Day     | Time           | Action               | Equipment Setting         | Est. Temp Gain | Est. Cost |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Day 1   | 10 AM – 4 PM   | Circulate + Solar    | Pump @1600 RPM             | ~2.5°F         | ~$0.90    |
|         | Night          | Cover                | Auto Cover Closed          | -1°F (loss)    | $0        |
| Day 2   | 10 AM – 4 PM   | Circulate + Solar    | Pump @1600 RPM             | ~2.5°F         | ~$0.90    |
|         | Night          | Cover                | Auto Cover Closed          | -1°F (loss)    | $0        |
| Day 3   | 10 AM – 4 PM   | Circulate + Solar    | Pump @1600 RPM             | ~2.5°F         | ~$0.90    |
|         | Night          | Cover                | Auto Cover Closed          | -1°F (loss)    | $0        |

**Total Solar-Only Temp Gain**: ~6.5°F in 3 days  
**Estimated Total Cost** (electricity only @ $0.30/kWh): ~$2.70

This gets you close to your target in a few sunny days. For quicker results, you could still do a 1-day gas kickstart, but this plan works well on a budget.
