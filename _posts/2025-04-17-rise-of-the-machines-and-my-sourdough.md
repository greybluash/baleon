# Can ChatGPT Teach Me to Make Gluten-Free Sourdough From Scratch?

They say making sourdough bread is a craft that takes years to perfect.  
They also say making *gluten-free* sourdough is even harder — more unpredictable, more delicate, and more mysterious.

So, naturally, I thought… what if I didn’t learn it from a baker at all?

What if I asked **ChatGPT** to teach me?

Welcome to my new kitchen experiment: a real-time, flour-covered journey to see if AI can guide me through something that has humbled even the most passionate home bakers — creating a gluten-free sourdough starter and baking a loaf from scratch.

## 🧪 Why Gluten-Free Sourdough?

I’m gluten-free by necessity, not trend, and I *miss* real bread. You know — crusty outside, tangy inside, good enough to eat plain with a slather of butter.

Gluten-free bread at the store? It often tastes like cardboard and costs more than a sandwich.

Sourdough has that *magic* — natural fermentation, wild yeast, and deep flavor. But gluten-free sourdough? That’s next-level. No gluten means no built-in structure, which makes it notoriously tricky to work with. You need science, timing, and patience.

Perfect time to bring in an AI sidekick, right?

## 🤖 The Rules of the Experiment

- I’ll follow **ChatGPT’s instructions**, step by step.
- I’ll document **everything** — the good, the bad, and the bubbly.
- No cheating with premade starters or store-bought mixes.
- If I fail, I fail. But if I succeed? I get warm, fresh bread and the bragging rights that a robot helped me make it.

Each day, I’ll update this post (or future entries) with what happened, photos, and what ChatGPT told me to do.

## 📅 The Plan (According to ChatGPT)

---

## 📦 Ingredients

### For the Starter
- 100g brown rice flour (or gluten-free whole grain flour)
- 100g filtered or distilled water (room temp)

### For the Bread (Once Starter is Ready)
- 200g active GF starter
- 400g gluten-free flour blend (see below)
- 300g water (adjust based on flour type)
- 8g salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional)

---

## 📅 Day-by-Day Starter Schedule

Feed daily at the same time. Use clean utensils & jars. Expect changes in smell and texture!

### Day 1
- Mix: 50g brown rice flour + 50g water in a clean jar.
- Stir well, cover loosely, and let sit at room temperature (~70–75°F).
- **Note**: It may look quiet. That’s okay!

---

### Day 2
- Discard half (~50g).
- Add: 50g flour + 50g water. Stir, cover loosely.
- **What to expect**: Maybe a few bubbles or a slightly sour smell.

---

### Day 3
- Discard half.
- Feed again with 50g flour + 50g water.
- **Note**: Smell may be tangy, sour, or fruity — that's good!

---

### Day 4
- Discard half.
- Feed same as before.
- **What to expect**: More activity, stronger smell, some rise and fall.

---

### Day 5
- Discard half.
- Feed: 50g flour + 50g water.
- **Note**: Starter should rise within 4–6 hours. Look for bubbles and dome shape.

---

### Day 6
- Repeat feeding.
- **If very bubbly**: You can test it in water — it should float!

---

### Day 7
- Optional: Split starter if you want to test different flours or keep backups.
- Continue feeding until you're ready to bake.

---

## 🍞 Bread Baking Steps

Once starter is active and bubbly, bake your first loaf.

### 1. Mix Dough
- Combine starter, water, flour, salt, and optional oil.
- Mix well. It should resemble thick cake batter (adjust water as needed).

### 2. Bulk Fermentation
- Cover and let rest for 4–8 hours at room temp.
- Dough should puff up, not necessarily double.

### 3. Shape & Proof
- Shape into a round and place in parchment-lined bowl or proofing basket.
- Cover and proof for 1–3 more hours or refrigerate overnight.

### 4. Bake
- Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with Dutch oven inside.
- Score the top of the dough.
- Transfer dough to hot Dutch oven, cover, and bake:
  - 30 min covered  
  - 15–20 min uncovered

### 5. Cool
- Let rest 2+ hours before slicing!

## 📝 Notes & Tips

- Always discard before feeding to prevent sourness and overgrowth.
- If starter smells foul or turns pink/gray, toss it.
- You can store discard in the fridge and use in pancakes, crackers, etc.
- Use non-chlorinated water — distilled or filtered is ideal.

---

## 🧪 Future Experiments
- Try different flours: sorghum, teff, millet, buckwheat.
- Test hydration levels (start with 100%).
- Try add-ins: herbs, olives, seeds.

---

## 📸 Documenting the Journey

I'll include daily photos, notes, smells (described, not shared — you're welcome), and results. If I tweak something, I’ll explain why.

You’ll get:
- Honest reactions (some may be unprintable)
- Unexpected insights
- Tips for anyone else trying this gluten-free baking thing with or without AI

## 🔥 Why This Matters (At Least to Me)

I’m doing this because I love learning through doing — and because I think AI has the power to become an amazing tool for teaching skills that usually take months or years to master. Not just coding or writing, but *craft*. Physical things. Delicious things.

If ChatGPT can help me bake a beautiful, edible, gluten-free sourdough loaf?  
That's not just bread. That’s potential.

Let’s see what happens.

**Follow along, and wish me luck.**  
Starter begins tomorrow. 👩‍🔬🥣  
Stay tuned for **Day 1**...
